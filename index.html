      <h2>Understanding Digital Citizenship</h2>

      <p>Digital citizenship is the responsible, safe, and respectful use of technology and the internet to engage with society. It involves understanding how to communicate, learn, and participate online in ways that are ethical and considerate. A good digital citizen recognizes that their actions in digital spaces—such as social media, email, or online communities—reflect their values and affect others. Being a digital citizen isn’t just about knowing how to use technology; it’s about using it with integrity, empathy, and awareness.</p>

        <h3>Rights, Responsibilities, and Online Safety</h3>

        <p>Being an effective digital citizen means knowing your online rights and taking responsibility for your digital actions. This includes protecting your personal information, using strong passwords, and thinking critically about what you share. It also means respecting others’ privacy, giving credit to original creators, and reporting harmful content when necessary. Practicing kindness and respect online helps create a safer, more inclusive digital environment free from cyberbullying, hate speech, and misinformation.</p>

        <h3>Managing Your Digital Footprint and Using Technology Ethically</h3>
        <p>Every online action—posts, comments, photos, and even search history—contributes to your digital footprint, the trail of data you leave behind. Managing this footprint responsibly is crucial for maintaining a positive online reputation. Think before posting, verify information before sharing, and use technology legally and ethically. Whether it’s citing sources, avoiding plagiarism, or being honest in digital communication, ethical technology use helps build trust and accountability in the digital world.</p>
