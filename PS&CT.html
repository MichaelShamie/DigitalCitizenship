      <h2>Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking</h2>

      <p>Problem-solving and critical thinking in computing involve using computational thinkingâ€”a process of breaking down problems, recognizing patterns, abstracting key information, and creating step-by-step algorithms to find solutions that can be executed by a computer. These skills are fundamental for programmers and involve analysis, logical reasoning, and methodical planning to develop and debug software, and they are transferable to many other fields.
