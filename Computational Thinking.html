      <h2>Computational Thinking</h2>

      <p>Decomposition: Breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, a large project can be decomposed into smaller tasks like planning, research, and writing. 
        Pattern Recognition: Identifying similarities, trends, and patterns within or between problems. This helps in using solutions for similar problems more efficiently. 
        Abstraction: Focusing on the essential information and ignoring irrelevant details to identify the core principles of a problem. This is crucial for creating models and making generalizations. 
        Algorithms: Developing a step-by-step set of instructions or rules to solve the problem or its sub-problems. This is the final step in creating a solution that can be executed.
